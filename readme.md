CQ DE BH9DWE. I once wrote an QSL management system by Qt and uploaded it to my GitHub. But when I return to it a few days ago, I found I cannot understand it anymore (lol). And I remember I just mixed Qt, std C++ and even conventional C together, which makes the programme hard to get uniformed. So, I rewrote the programme use entire Qt frame with all function. Here it is.
## How to use it
This programme added user account system. When firstly running, you must register an account in it. Just use root user (username: root, password: 8888) and click "Register" key and into register form. Fill your callsign(username), password and phone number (not used yet, you can type any words in it such as "114514"), then use these username and password to log in.

When logged in, you can manually add QSO and import ADIF function. When QSO logged, your QSO will be shown in the table. You can sort your QSOs, set filter to find your QSO and double-click your QSO in the table and modify it.

## It has not been finished
QSL card function, statistics function, Grid/DXCC/CQ Zone information storage function and a lot of plan has not been added in this programme. I will add them one by one later.
